“A stitch in time saves nine” my mum used to say and this has instilled in me the niche of doing the needful to quickly identify and resolve issues/problems hence preventing further or more grievous damage. Little did I know that this would become applicable in my professional life; looking back over my Networking career, the highlights for me were moments I had to troubleshoot networks, reviewing the design, device/firewall configurations, and logs to investigate root cause of service disruptions. I derived a great sense of fulfilment in being able to put the right security controls in place to mitigate malicious attacks and guarantee optimal uptime availability and performance of the network for critical systems and users. This piqued my interest in Cybersecurity as I realized how vital securing data assets is to business continuity. I actively work to identify and analyze potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to security and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets, to help safeguard organizations and people alike.
